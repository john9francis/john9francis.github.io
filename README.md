## Current announcements
[Monte carlo modeler](https://montecarlomodeler.com) is now officially published! I need alpha testers before I give the public full access, so for now just check out the "browse public models" section. If you are interested in helping test the website, shoot me an email at montecarlomodeler@gmail.com

## About me:
I am from Orem UT, and attended BYU - Idaho in Rexburg ID where I got my bachelor's degree in physics. I am currently working on a master's degree in medical physics at the University of Florida (go gators! ðŸ¦Ž)

I care about creating safe, reliable, and performant software. I have had experience working with and developing Geant4 applications, and have many side-projects on my [github page.](https://github.com/john9francis)

In my free time I like spending time with my wife, kids, and dog. I also do some game development, and am proud to present some of my games at [john9francis.itch.io](https://john9francis.itch.io/). I like being active whether it be skateboarding, going to the gym, or spending time outside.
